# fakemodex
A simple wrapper to allow playing games that use FMODex with FMOD

Note that this Wrapper cannot be used for serious developpement. It's a simple Workaround for ARM Linux platform were FMODex cannot be found.
Many function are ignored or will just do nothing. It works for the games I tried, and that's it.

FMOD and FMod EX are property of Firelight Technologies Pty Ltd
